# Where are we gonna eat - live poll - PE
A live polling app based around making dinner arrangements for the teacher and his class. The teacher will present a couple of options for the students to choose from. The students make their choice based on these options. When all of the forms are submitted the results will be presented.
OPTIONAL;
based on the results, an extra api call can be made to present some restaurants to the class.

## Progressive enhancements
This assignment was made with PE in mind. The challenge is to make a progressive webapp that works on every device, every connection. Even without Javascript. You will notice that some functionalities don't work when JS is disabled. But the core idea of the app still functions.
